This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust programming involving mutable and immutable references. The `bug.rs` file contains code that attempts to modify a value through an immutable reference, which results in a compile-time error. The `bugSolution.rs` file provides a corrected version, illustrating the correct way to handle mutable and immutable references.
